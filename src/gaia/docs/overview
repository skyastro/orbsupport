The files in this project are associated with getting data from the Gaia EDR3 Nearby Stars Catalog
into a format that we can use for the local Galactic neighborhood.

There are two issues that need to be addressed.  First, while the catalog uses DR3 identifiers, other sources,
SIMBAD and the NASA Exoplanet archive only have DR2 identifiers, so we need to be able to translate between
the two.

Second, the GAIA archive is incomplete for very bright stars, so we need to include additional bright stars from
the Hipparcos data that we have already extracted.

The packages/programs included here are:

   readcsv.CSVReader:  Read a CSV version of the Nearby Stars Catalog and render it in a JSON
like format extracting only columns of interest and renaming them.
